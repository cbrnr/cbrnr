## About me
I am a senior postdoc with a background in electrical/biomedical engineering and computer engineering. I work at the [Educational Neuroscience group](https://psychologie.uni-graz.at/en/educational-neuroscience/) at the [Institute of Psychology](https://psychologie.uni-graz.at/en/), [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/), Austria.

I am interested in neuroscientific substrates of number processing and arithmetic, EEG oscillations and connectivity analysis, biomedical signal processing, applied machine learning and statistics, brain-computer interfaces, and software development. I am a big fan of open source software and I believe that science should be open as well, including data and analysis scripts. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is my favorite language, but I also enjoy performing data analysis and statistical tests with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (thanks in particular to its awesome [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)). I have also started to use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) recently.

I maintain and develop the following larger projects:
- [MNELAB](https://github.com/cbrnr/mnelab), a graphical user interface for processing EEG/MEG data using [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools)
- [SleepECG](https://github.com/cbrnr/sleepecg), a Python package for sleep staging using ECG (which includes a fast R-peak detector)
- [HeartBeats.jl](https://github.com/cbrnr/HeartBeats.jl), a Pan-Tompkins R-peak ECG detector in Julia
- [XDF.jl](https://github.com/cbrnr/XDF.jl), a Julia package for reading [XDF](https://github.com/sccn/xdf/wiki/Specifications) files
- [SigViewer](https://github.com/cbrnr/sigviewer), a Qt/C++ based biosignal visualization tool
- [SCoT](https://github.com/scot-dev/scot), a Python package for EEG-based source connectivity estimation

In addition, I am part of the [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools) and [pyXDF](https://github.com/xdf-modules/xdf-Python) development teams, and I have contributed to numerous open source projects such as [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [pybv](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybv), [BioSig](http://biosig.sourceforge.net/), and several smaller contributions for other projects (check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cbrnr) for a detailed activity summary).

I mainly work on macOS, but I also like [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), for which I maintain [several packages in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?SeB=m&K=cbrnr).
